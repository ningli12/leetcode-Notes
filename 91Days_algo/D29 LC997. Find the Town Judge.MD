## 997. Find the Town Judge

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

Example 4:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1

Example 5:
Input: n = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3

1: Two Arrays
- 遍历trust
  - 法官在每个数组的[i][0]应该为0: 出度-你相信的人
  - 法官在每个数组的[i][1]应该有n-1个: 入度-相信他的人
- 两者同时达成为法官，否则没有
```
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        // 人员编号从1开始，这里 + 1防止后续计算麻烦
        int[] indegree = new int[n + 1];
        int[] outdegree = new int[n + 1];
        
        for(int[] relation : trust) {
            outdegree[relation[0]]++; //出度-你相信的人
            indegree[relation[1]]++; // 入度-相信他的人
        }
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            if(indegree[i] == n - 1 && outdegree[i] == 0) { //不信任他人，同时获得n-1张相信的人为法官
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

2: One Array
### 复杂度分析
- Time Complexity : O(E).
Same as above. We still need to loop through the E edges in trust, and the argument about the relationship between N and E still applies.
- Space Complexity : O(N).
Same as above. We're still allocating an array of length N.

```
public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
    if (trust.length < N - 1) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    int[] trustScores = new int[N + 1];

    for (int[] relation : trust) {
        trustScores[relation[0]]--;
        trustScores[relation[1]]++; 
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (trustScores[i] == N - 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
