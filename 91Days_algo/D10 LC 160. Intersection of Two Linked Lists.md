## LC 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/solution/

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'

### HashSet
First traverse list A and use a hash set to record visited, then traverse B, the first node of visited node will be the intersection, if there's no such a node, that means no intersection.
```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        Set<ListNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
        while (headA != null) {
            visited.add(headA);
            headA = headA.next;
        }

        while (headB != null) {
            if (visited.contains(headB)) {
                return headB;
            }
            headB = headB.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(m + n)
- Space: O(m)

### Method 2. Two Pointers
First traverse both arrays to find their lengths, then use two pointers pA and pB to traverse both lists. Before we start tracersal, move the pointer of the longer list forward by abs(lA-lB).

```
//遍历两次求长度
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        int lengthA = 0;
        ListNode curA = headA;
        while(curA != null){
            curA = curA.next;
            lengthA++;
        }
        int lengthB = 0;
        ListNode curB = headB;
        while(curB != null){
            curB = curB.next;
            lengthB++;
        }
        
        ListNode headLong = lengthA >= lengthB?headA: headB;
        ListNode headShort = lengthA >= lengthB?headB: headA;
        int diff = Math.abs(lengthA - lengthB);
        
        while(diff > 0){
            headLong = headLong.next;
            diff--;
        }
        
        while(headLong != headShort){
            headLong = headLong.next;
            headShort = headShort.next;
        }
        
        return headLong;
    }
}

```
