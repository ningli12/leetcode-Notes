## LC 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9] Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5] Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST. Example 2:

Input: head = [] Output: [] Example 3:

Input: head = [0] Output: [0] Example 4:

Input: head = [1,3] Output: [3,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104]. -105 <= Node.val <= 105

### 思路
Method 1. Divide and Conquer
Main Idea
If we pick a node as root of the tree, then we will need to determine the left and right subtrees with the list nodes on the left and right hand sides, which is the same problem but with a smaller size.

Also, we want the BST to be balanced, so when constructing the tree, we want to choose the middle list node as the root, so left and right will have same number of nodes, or one side will have an extra node.

Algorithm

Base case: If there is only one node left, return it as a new TreeNode.
Get the middle node.
Recusrivly call the function on the left and right lists and get the left and right subtree.

## CODE
```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        if (head.next == null) return new TreeNode(head.val);
        
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        ListNode prev = head;
        while (prev.next != slow) {
            prev = prev.next;
        }
        prev.next = null;
        TreeNode left = sortedListToBST(head);
        TreeNode right = sortedListToBST(slow.next);
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(slow.val);
        root.left = left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }
}

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(nlogn), divide and conquer.
- Space: O(height) = O(logn) for recursive calls.

### 思路
### Method 2. In-Order Traversal
Main Idea
The bottleneck of method 1 is that we have to either find the mid node each recursive call or convert the linked list to array list, which either costs time or space. But can we do better?

First recall the fact that a sorted list/array is the in-order traversal of a bst. Which means we can traverse the list once, and build the tree, like how we did in-order traversal, the left subtree is traversed and built first, then we create the root node, finally the right subtree.

We can use a global variable cur to represent the current node we are processing. Since we are doing an in-order traversal, all the nodes will be created in order, e.g, node i won't be created until all nodes 0:i-1 are cteated.

Algorithm

Define inOrder(int i, int j) to be the problem of the converting list[i:j] to BST.
Base case: if i > j, return null.
Calculate mid = i + (j - i) / 2, left subtree will be inOrder(i, mid - 1), and then we create our root with the current node cur, then the next node to create will be cur.next, and we build the right sutree with inOrder(mid + 1, j).
Code
```
class Solution {
    private ListNode cur;
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        cur = head;
        int n = getLength(head);
        return inOrder(0, n - 1);
    }

    private TreeNode inOrder(int l, int r) {
        if (l > r) return null;
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        TreeNode left = inOrder(l, m - 1);
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(cur.val);
        cur = cur.next;
        TreeNode right = inOrder(m + 1, r);
        root.left = left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }

    private int getLength(ListNode head) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (head != null) {
            head = head.next;
            ++cnt;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
