## 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:
Input: s = ""
Output: 0

### 思路
Return N if the string length N is smaller than 3.
Set both set pointers in the beginning of the string left = 0 and right = 0 
While right pointer is less than N:
    If hashmap contains less or equal to 2 distinct characters, add the current character s[right] in the hashmap and move right pointer to the right.
    If hashmap contains more than 2 distinct characters, remove the leftmost character from the hashmap and move the left pointer so that sliding window contains again 2 distinct characters only.
    Update distinct.

```
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n < 3) return n;
        int l = 0;
        int r = 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int distinct = 0;

        while(r < n) {
            // when the slidewindow contains less or equal to 2 characters
            if(map.size() <= 2) {
                map.put(s.charAt(r), r);
                r++;
            }
            // slidewindow contains more than 2 characters
            if(map.size() > 2) {
                int left = s.length();
                // delete the leftmost character
                for(int i : map.values()) {
                    left = Math.min(left, i);
                }
                map.remove(s.charAt(left));
                // move left pointer of the slidewindow
                l = left + 1;
            }
            distinct = Math.max(distinct, r - l);
        }
        return distinct;
    }
}
```

### 时间
- Time complexity :O(N) where N is a number of characters in the input string.
- Space complexity : O(1) since additional space is used only for a hashmap with at most 3 elements.
