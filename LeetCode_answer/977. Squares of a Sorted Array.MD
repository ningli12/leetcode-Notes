## 977. Squares of a Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

Approach 2: Two Pointer
We can use two pointers to read the positive and negative parts of the array - one pointer j in the positive direction, and another i in the negative direction.
Now that we are reading two increasing arrays (the squares of the elements), we can merge these arrays together using a two-pointer technique.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int i = 0, j = n - 1;
        for (int p = n - 1; p >= 0; p--) {
            if (Math.abs(A[i]) > Math.abs(A[j])) {
                result[p] = A[i] * A[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                result[p] = A[j] * A[j];
                j--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
