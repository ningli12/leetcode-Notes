## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

### 思路
 * Key point: 
 * if a node only has one child -> MUST return the depth of the side with child, i.e. MAX(left, right) + 1
 * if a node has two children on both side -> return min depth of two sides, i.e. MIN(left, right) + 1

###代码
```
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int left = minDepth(root.left);
        int right = minDepth(root.right);
        if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
            return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
        }
        else {
            return Math.min(left, right) + 1;
        }
    }
}
```
