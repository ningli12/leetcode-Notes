## 200. Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

```
class Solution {
  void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    int nr = grid.length;
    int nc = grid[0].length;

    if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= nr || c >= nc || grid[r][c] == '0') {
      return;
    }

    grid[r][c] = '0';
    dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
    dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
  }

  public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    int nr = grid.length;
    int nc = grid[0].length;
    int num_islands = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < nr; ++r) {
      for (int c = 0; c < nc; ++c) {
        if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
          ++num_islands;
          dfs(grid, r, c);
        }
      }
    }

    return num_islands;
  }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
Time complexity : O(M×N) where MM is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
Space complexity : worst case O(M×N) in case that the grid map is filled with lands where DFS goes by M×N deep.
