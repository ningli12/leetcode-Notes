## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

### 思路
方法一：递归

方法二：存储父节点
思路
我们可以用哈希表存储所有节点的父节点，然后我们就可以利用节点的父节点信息从 p 结点开始不断往上跳，并记录已经访问过的节点，再从 q 节点开始不断往上跳，如果碰到已经访问过的节点，那么这个节点就是我们要找的最近公共祖先。

If we have parent pointers for each node we can traverse back from p and q to get their ancestors. The first common node we get during this traversal would be the LCA node. We can save the parent pointers in a dictionary as we traverse the tree.

算法
从根节点开始遍历整棵二叉树，用哈希表记录每个节点的父节点指针。
从 p 节点开始不断往它的祖先移动，并用数据结构记录已经访问过的祖先节点。
同样，我们再从 q 节点开始不断往它的祖先移动，如果有祖先已经被访问过，即意味着这是 p 和 q 的深度最深的公共祖先，即 LCA 节点。

Start from the root node and traverse the tree.
Until we find p and q both, keep storing the parent pointers in a dictionary.
Once we have found both p and q, we get all the ancestors for p using the parent dictionary and add to a set called ancestors.
Similarly, we traverse through ancestors for node q. If the ancestor is present in the ancestors set for p, this means this is the first ancestor common between p and q (while traversing upwards) and hence this is the LCA node.

```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        Map<TreeNode, TreeNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        stack.push(root);
        map.put(root, null);
  
        while(!map.containsKey(p) || !map.containsKey(q)) {
            TreeNode cur = stack.pop();
            if(cur.left != null) {
                stack.push(cur.left);
                map.put(cur.left, cur);
            }
            if(cur.right != null) {
                stack.push(cur.right);
                map.put(cur.right, cur);
            }
        }
  
        Set<TreeNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        while(p != null) {
            set.add(p);
            p = map.get(p);
        }

        while (!set.contains(q)){
            q = map.get(q);
        }
        return q;      
    }
}
```
